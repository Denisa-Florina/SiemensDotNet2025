# üå∏ How to Start the Application

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred method.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Repository Folder
Go to the folder where the repository has been cloned.

### Step 3: Run the Application
You have two options for running the application:

### Option 3.1: Run the Executable File
If you just want to run the app, navigate to the following directory and run the executable file: ".\ProblemSiemensDonNet\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows\ProblemSiemensDonNet.exe"

### Option 3.2: Open the Code in an IDE
If you want to explore the code behind the application, open the solution file (`.sln`) in your favorite IDE. I used **JetBrains Rider**, but any IDE that supports .NET will work.
Open the solution file: ProblemSiemensDonNet.sln

# üåê My feature

The application includes a statistics feature that lets users view and export book data grouped by categories like Author, Genre, Year, Pages, or Stock. 

The chart updates automatically in real time whenever books are added, deleted, or modified, ensuring the displayed information is always current. The option to export the chart data as a CSV file makes it easy to use the information outside the app for reports, sharing, or further analysis.
